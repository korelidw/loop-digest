# Methods & Experiments

This page documents the analysis methods, data handling, and active experiments.

- Data window: default 14 days (America/Chicago)
- Deterministic analysis first; LLM only narrates and critiques
- Corrections lens: primary metric = median drop per unit at 120 minutes; ISF bias computed vs profile ISF by daypart

See repository README for full methodology details.
